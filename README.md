## üìùDescription

Traditional personal finance trackers often fall short in terms of data security and privacy. Centralized systems may be susceptible to data breaches and unauthorized access, putting users' financial information at risk. Additionally, manual data entry and disjointed platforms make it challenging to gain a holistic view of one's financial health.

FinFolio Plus leverages blockchain technology to address these challenges, providing users with a secure and efficient personal finance management experience.

1. Enhanced Security: With FinFolio Plus, your financial data is secured using blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature. Say goodbye to worries about data breaches or unauthorized access, as your information remains encrypted and protected.
2. Secure Transactions: The platform uses blockchain technology to secure and track transactions amongst users, ensuring the safety and transparency of financial transactions.
3. Smart Contracts: The platform can be powered by smart contracts, automatically executing the terms of transaction updates, additions and removals..
4. Data Privacy: User data is protected by the immutable and secure nature of blockchain technology, ensuring privacy and security.

## üí∏Applications

FinFolio+ is a Blockchain-Based Personal Finance Tracker which is a cutting-edge application that harnesses the power of blockchain technology to revolutionize the way you track and manage your personal finances. With its secure and transparent framework, this tracker provides a seamless experience that puts you in control of your financial journey. Following are some of its features:

* Expense Tracking:  The ability to record and categorize expenses, allowing users to monitor where their money is being spent and identify areas for potential savings.

* Income Tracking:  The system should provide a means to input and track sources of income, such as salaries, investments, or rental income.

* Budgeting: A budgeting feature helps users set financial goals and allocate funds accordingly. It should allow for the creation of customized budgets, track spending against those budgets, and provide alerts or notifications when approaching or exceeding budget limits.

## How have we used GitHub Copilot? 
* Generating Transaction Validation Logic: When implementing the transaction recording functionality, Copilot assisted in generating code for validating transaction data, ensuring that required fields are present, and performing necessary checks for data consistency.

* Creating Chart Visualization: Copilot provided code snippets for generating charts and visualizing financial data. It suggested libraries or functions to use for chart creation, along with the necessary data formatting and styling options.

* Implementing Blockchain Integration: Copilot helped with the integration of blockchain technology by providing code examples for interacting with the blockchain network. It suggested functions or methods for creating wallets, sending transactions, or querying blockchain data.

## üõ†Project Setup

>Include your project setup basics here. Steps for how someone else can setup your project on their machine. Add any relevant details as well.

* STEP 1: [Install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm): Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications in JavaScript and run them on the server. It includes a rich library of modules, known as npm (Node Package Manager), that enables developers to add functionality to their applications quickly and easily. It is widely used for web application development, building networked applications, and developing server-side scripts.
* STEP 2: [Install Metamask Extension](https://metamask.io/) MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app that provides an interface for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely store, manage, and send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens, as well as interact with dApps in a user-friendly way.
* STEP 3: [Configure a Metamask Account](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/#why-metamask)
